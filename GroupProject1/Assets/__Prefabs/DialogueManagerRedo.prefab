    don''t want to make him mad!'
  - 'You: I see. How do I get out of here?'
  - 'Mirthal: This room has puzzles that you have to solve. You can look through
    all of the objects in this room by clicking on them.'

    have to put together in order to get out of here.'
  - 'Mirthal: If you find yourself struggling, you can ask for hints using the "hint
    button", but there will be consequences... We will start in a non-violent room,
    but it will get more difficult as we go through the castle. Brace yourself!'
  - 'You: Got it!'
